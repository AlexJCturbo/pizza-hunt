## Project Description
Pizza Hunt is a social media application that lets users connect with each other based on their love of pizza. In Pizza Hunt, users can share and discuss their dream pizza-topping combinations.

This project develops the backend part of the application "Pizza Hunt", a web page where users can create pizza recipes, post comments on other users' pizzas and add replies to comments.

The project created the Express.js API routes and connects the back end to the NoSQL-database MongoDB to handle pizzas data and comments. Finally, this porject integrates the API code with the clientâ€™s existing frontend codebase.
